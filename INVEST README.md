# Airgeat Banking Services

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was to develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. 

# What did you do particularly well?
Throughout the course of this project the one thing that really strikes me is how well I kept to naming conventions and made sure to have code that could be easily readable for other people.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The one area where I could enhance my code is that I might split some of the code into different classes. I think this would lead the code to become more readable and allow for code to be more easily maintained and deployed without redundancy. This would allow for better security of data as well, because I would privatize--or atleast protect attributes--and alter/get the information with setters and getters.

# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
From what I remember, the major issue I had to deal with when writing this code was formatting code correctly. Eventually after reading more into escape sequences it became easier, but initially to get the code how I envisioned it took a bit of maneuvering.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The skills that are easily transferable to future other projects are conventions. I really was able to make best practices when it came down to naming conventions and also proper names to use throughout the code.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The way I made this code maintainable was sticking to proper conventions and using adequate documentation and commenting.
